## Profile ##

 I am a student of Minsk State Linguistic University with a strong knowledge of English. I am currently seeking for new opportunities to develop my hard skills in different fields, including IT. I previously had some experience with programming, but decided to take it up to the next level by joining RS School course which will help me to learn the profession of a Front-End Developer. Really looking forward to it! During the course i will learn these technologies:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Code Example ##

```function fizzbuzz(n)
{
  let ar = [];
  for ( let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if ( (i % 3 === 0) && (i % 5 === 0)) {
      ar.push('FizzBuzz');
    }
    else if ( i % 3 === 0 ) {
      ar.push("Fizz");
    }
    else if ( i % 5 === 0) {
      ar.push("Buzz");
    }
    else {
      ar.push(i);
    }
  }
  return ar;
}
```
